## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Multiple Features Introduction

**Important notation:**
- n = number of features  
- m = number of training examples  
- x(i) = features of i-th training example  
- xj(i) = value of feature j in i-th training example

### 🔹 Model Extension

**Evolution of the model:**
- Previously: fw,b(x) = wx + b  
- Now with multiple features: fw,b(x) = w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + w₃x₃ + w₄x₄ + b  

---

### 🔹 Vector Notation

**Modern representation using vectors:**
- w = [w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ] → parameter vector  
- x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ] → feature vector  
- b is a scalar (bias term)  
- Final model: fw,b(x) = w · x + b  

**Important Note:**  
This is multiple linear regression (one output, multiple features), **not** multivariate regression (multiple outputs).

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Multiple features allow more complex and accurate predictions  
- Vector notation simplifies representation of multiple features  
- Dot product provides elegant mathematical formulation  
- Each feature has its own weight parameter (w)  
- Base value (b) remains a single scalar

- Keep track of feature indices carefully  
- Document feature meanings and units  
- Consider feature scaling for better performance  
- Use proper indexing notation in code
