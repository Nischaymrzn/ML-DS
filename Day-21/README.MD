## ✅ Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Understood the concept of **indefinite integrals** as antiderivatives  
- Practiced core **integration rules** (linearity, power rule, constants)  
- Briefly explored **definite integrals** and their geometric meaning

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Indefinite Integrals

- Represent the **antiderivative** of a function:  
  \[
  \int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + C
  \]  
  where \( C \) is the constant of integration  
- Used to reverse differentiation  
- Example:  
  \[
  \int x^2\,dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
  \]

### 🔹 Rules of Indefinite Integration

- **Linearity**:  
  \[
  \int [af(x) + bg(x)]\,dx = a\int f(x)\,dx + b\int g(x)\,dx
  \]  
- **Power Rule**:  
  \[
  \int x^n\,dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C,\quad n \neq -1
  \]  
- **Constant Multiplication**:  
  \[
  \int a \cdot f(x)\,dx = a \cdot \int f(x)\,dx
  \]

### 🔹 Definite Integrals (Intro)

- Represent the **net area under a curve** from \( a \) to \( b \):  
  \[
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx
  \]  
- Result is a number (not a function)  
- Applications: area, probability, expectations, and cumulative values in ML

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Indefinite integrals are the inverse of derivatives and include "+ C"  
- Integration rules help break down complex expressions step-by-step  
- Definite integrals connect calculus to real-world quantities like area and total change
