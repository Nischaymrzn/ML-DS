# Topic: K-Means Clustering with Real-World Datasets

## Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Applied K-Means clustering on two real-world datasets: Wine and Mall Customer Segmentation  
- Compared results of standard K-Means vs. K-Means++ initialization  
- Reviewed and consolidated the full K-Means clustering workflow  

---

## Detailed Notes

### Datasets Used

- **Wine Dataset:** Used for clustering wine samples based on chemical properties  
- **Mall Customer Segmentation:** Grouped customers based on purchasing behavior  

### Key Insights

- K-Means++ initialization consistently improved clustering performance and convergence speed  
- Visual comparisons showed clearer, more distinct clusters with K-Means++  
- Full K-Means process includes: initialization, assignment, update, and evaluation

## Key Takeaways

- Centroid initialization greatly affects K-Means clustering outcomes  
- Working with real-world data helps understand practical challenges and tuning  
- Always evaluate clustering quality when choosing hyperparameters like the number of clusters
