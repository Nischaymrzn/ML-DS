# Topic: Supervised Learning & Model Validation

## Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Revisited core supervised learning concepts  
- Understood underfitting vs. overfitting in model training  
- Applied concepts to real-world data using Kaggle's Housing Prices dataset  

## Detailed Notes

### Supervised Learning Review

- Refreshed understanding of regression and classification  
- Discussed how models generalize and the importance of balancing bias and variance  

### Model Evaluation and Validation

- Emphasized the importance of splitting data into training and validation sets  
- Discussed strategies to avoid overfitting and underfitting  
- Introduced validation techniques for better performance estimation  

### Practical Application

- Applied EDA, preprocessing, and modeling on the Housing Prices Kaggle competition  
- Focused on model selection, tuning, and evaluation  

## Key Takeaways

- Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple; overfitting when itâ€™s too complex  
- Proper validation helps estimate real-world performance  
- Hands-on practice improves understanding of data preparation and modeling flow  

## Practical Implementation Tips

- Use cross-validation to validate performance  
- Regularly monitor learning curves for bias-variance tradeoff  
- Always clean and preprocess data before modeling
