# 📚 Continuous AI/ML Learning Journey

Welcome to my evolving journey of mastering Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) through consistent, focused daily effort.
My goal is to develop a strong theoretical foundation and practical skills in AI/ML through focused, consistent effort.

This repository documents my progress across two major learning challenges: 

### 🔹 111 Days of AIML Learning (Code for Change)
📅 **Progress: Day 1 to Day 45 completed**

A self-initiated challenge to master the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of machine learning.

---

### 🔹 60 Days of Learning (Leapfrog)
📅 **Started from Day 49 onward**

This challenge continues my learning journey under Leapfrog’s 60-day sprint, aiming to deepen my understanding, improve practical skills, and build real-world projects.

---

## 🚀 Why This Journey?

- To build deep theoretical understanding of AIML concepts.
- To master mathematical foundations: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics, Optimization.
- To explore classical ML algorithms and the theory behind deep learning.
- To complete mini-projects and a major capstone project demonstrating real-world applications.

## 🗓️ Structure of the 111 Days

| Phase    |  Focus Area                                             |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
| Phase 1  |  Mathematical Foundations + Targeted Python Revision    |
| Phase 2  |  Core Machine Learning Theory and Algorithms            |
| Phase 3  |  Advanced Topics (Deep Learning, RL) + Capstone Project |

Each day, I will update this repository with:
- 📄 A brief **summary** of what I learned
- 🧮 Mathematical **derivations/notes**
- 🛠️ **Mini-coding experiments** (where needed)
- 🎯 Key **insights** and **reflections**
