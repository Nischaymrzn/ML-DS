# 📚 111 Days of AIML Learning | #CodeForChange

Welcome to my journey of mastering Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) over **111 continuous days**!  
This repository tracks my daily learning, key takeaways, project builds, and personal reflections.  
My goal is to develop a strong theoretical foundation and practical skills in AI/ML through focused, consistent effort.

---

## 🚀 Why This Journey?

- To build deep theoretical understanding of AIML concepts.
- To master mathematical foundations: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics, Optimization.
- To explore classical ML algorithms and the theory behind deep learning.
- To complete mini-projects and a major capstone project demonstrating real-world applications.
