## ✅ Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Understood how Naive Bayes applies Bayes' Theorem with the assumption of feature independence  
- Explored its effectiveness for classification tasks, especially on text data  
- Implemented Naive Bayes using scikit-learn and tested on sample datasets

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Naive Bayes Overview

- Based on Bayes' Theorem  
- Assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label  
- Simplifies computation of posterior probabilities for classification  

---

### 🔹 Application in Classification

- Particularly effective for high-dimensional data like text classification and spam detection  
- Fast training and prediction due to simple calculations  

---

### 🔹 Implementation Notes

- Use appropriate variant depending on data type: Gaussian, Multinomial, or Bernoulli Naive Bayes  
- Requires proper feature extraction and preprocessing (e.g., TF-IDF for text)

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- The independence assumption is a simplification but works well in practice  
- Naive Bayes is a strong baseline for many classification problems  
- Easy to implement and interpret
