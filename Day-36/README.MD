## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

- Core principle for estimating model parameters by maximizing the likelihood of observed data  
- In logistic regression, MLE corresponds to minimizing the log loss cost function  
- Finds parameters that make the observed data most probable under the model  

---

### 🔹 Regularization Techniques

- Add penalty terms to the cost function to discourage complex models  
- **L1 regularization (Lasso):** Encourages sparsity by penalizing absolute values of coefficients  
- **L2 regularization (Ridge):** Penalizes the squared magnitude of coefficients, encouraging smaller weights  
- Helps prevent overfitting by controlling model complexity

### 🔹 Model Implementation and Evaluation

- Logistic regression implemented using scikit-learn’s `LogisticRegression` class  
- Cross-validation applied to ensure model generalizes well to unseen data  
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall to measure classification performance

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- MLE provides a solid statistical foundation for logistic regression parameter estimation  
- Regularization balances bias-variance trade-off and improves model robustness  
- Cross-validation and proper evaluation metrics are essential for reliable model assessment
