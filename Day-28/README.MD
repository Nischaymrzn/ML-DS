## ✅ Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Understanding the impact of bias and variance on model performance  
- Recognizing the signs of underfitting and overfitting  
- Exploring strategies to balance the bias-variance trade-off

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Bias and Variance Defined

- **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model  
- **Variance**: Error due to model sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set  

---

### 🔹 Underfitting vs. Overfitting

- **High Bias (Underfitting)**:  
  - Model is too simple  
  - Fails to capture underlying patterns  
  - High training and test error  

- **High Variance (Overfitting)**:  
  - Model is too complex  
  - Captures noise as if it were signal  
  - Low training error, high test error

### 🔹 The Trade-off

- Balancing bias and variance is essential for optimal model performance  
- Goal is to achieve low generalization error  
- Requires tuning model complexity and data preprocessing techniques

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Bias-variance trade-off explains the balance between model simplicity and complexity  
- Underfitting and overfitting are practical symptoms of this trade-off  
- A well-generalized model minimizes both bias and variance

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Use cross-validation to detect overfitting or underfitting  
- Tune hyperparameters to find the right model complexity  
- Use regularization techniques to reduce variance  
- Gather more data or simplify model to address high variance
