## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Support Vector Regression (SVR) Overview

- SVR applies the principles of Support Vector Machines to regression problems  
- Uses margin-based loss function to find a function within a specified margin of tolerance (epsilon)  
- Focuses on fitting the data while maintaining model complexity and robustness  

---

### 🔹 Key Hyperparameters in SVR

- **Kernel:** Defines the function space (linear, polynomial, RBF)  
- **C (Regularization parameter):** Controls trade-off between margin width and training error  
- **Epsilon (ε):** Defines margin of tolerance where no penalty is given to errors  
- **Gamma:** Kernel coefficient for RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels

### 🔹 Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV

- Systematically explores combinations of hyperparameters  
- Uses cross-validation to find the best parameter set that generalizes well  
- Improves SVR performance by balancing bias and variance

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- SVR is powerful for regression tasks, especially with non-linear relationships  
- Proper hyperparameter tuning is essential for good generalization  
- GridSearchCV automates and simplifies the tuning process

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Start with a linear kernel for simple problems, then explore RBF or polynomial for non-linear data  
- Tune C and epsilon carefully as they strongly affect model performance  
- Use cross-validation results to avoid overfitting during hyperparameter search  
- Visualize model predictions to validate tuning effectiveness
