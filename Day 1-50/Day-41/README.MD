## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 SVM Fundamentals

- SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes  
- Support vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane, influencing its position  

---

### 🔹 Kernel Trick

- Transforms data into higher-dimensional space to make it linearly separable  
- Common kernels: Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Sigmoid  

---

### 🔹 Practical Implementation

- Train SVM classifier on medical dataset for binary classification  
- Tune kernel type and regularization parameters for improved accuracy
