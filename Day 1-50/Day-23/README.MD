## 🧰 Tools Reviewed

### 📦 NumPy
- Used for numerical operations, arrays, and vectorized computation
- Key operations: broadcasting, reshaping, aggregation (`mean`, `sum`, etc.)

### 📊 Pandas
- Efficient for data cleaning and manipulation with `DataFrame`
- Common tasks practiced:
  - Handling missing values
  - Grouping & aggregation
  - Sorting & filtering
  - Creating new columns

### 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Used for visualizing distributions, trends, and correlations
- Visuals included:
  - Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots
  - Heatmaps for correlation matrices

## 🔬 California Housing Dataset: EDA Insights

- Loaded dataset from `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()`
- Applied EDA steps:
  - Checked for missing/null values
  - Explored feature distributions (e.g. `MedInc`, `AveRooms`, `HouseAge`)
  - Visualized relationships between features and target (`MedHouseVal`)
  - Identified correlations using heatmaps

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Efficient data handling is critical before applying ML models
- Visual exploration often reveals hidden patterns and potential data issues
- Understanding your dataset through EDA can guide better feature engineering and model selection
