## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Sandpit Analogy

- Gradient descent likened to sliding down the steepest slope of a sandpit  
- Helps visualize how the algorithm iteratively moves toward the minimum point  

---

### 🔹 Steepest Descent Strategy

- Direction chosen as the negative gradient (steepest descent) at each step  
- Step size (learning rate) must be tuned for efficient and stable convergence  

---

### 🔹 Curvature Effects

- **Concave Up**: Function curves upward; gradient descent leads to minima  
- **Concave Down**: Function curves downward; points are maxima, not minima  
- **Saddle Points**: Points where gradient is zero but are neither maxima nor minima; special care needed during optimization
