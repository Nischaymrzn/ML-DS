# Topic: Cross-Validation & Feature Engineering

## Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Applied Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation for balanced evaluation  
- Explored feature engineering techniques for improving model input quality  
- Built a Brain Tumor Prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

## Detailed Notes

### Cross-Validation

- **Stratified K-Fold** ensures that each fold maintains class proportions  
- Helps reduce bias in classification tasks with imbalanced data  
- Provides more reliable model evaluation than a single train-test split  

### Feature Engineering Techniques

- **Correlation-Based Removal**: Eliminated highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity  
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Selected top-performing features by recursively eliminating the least important  
- **Tree-Based Feature Importance**: Leveraged feature importances from ensemble methods to identify useful predictors  

### Brain Tumor Prediction with SVM

- Implemented a Support Vector Machine to classify presence of brain tumors  
- Tuned model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy  
- Evaluated model using cross-validation for generalization performance  

## Key Takeaways

- Cross-validation ensures models are tested fairly and thoroughly  
- Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance  
- SVM is effective for binary classification when properly tuned  

## Practical Implementation Tips

- Use StratifiedKFold for imbalanced classification tasks  
- Analyze feature correlations early to avoid redundancy  
- Combine domain knowledge with algorithmic methods (like RFE) for feature selection
