## ✅ Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Understanding how Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regression reduce overfitting  
- Learning how regularization penalizes large coefficients  
- Implementing Ridge and Lasso regression models  
- Evaluating the impact of regularization on model performance

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Regularization Overview

- Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting  
- Helps keep model coefficients small and reduces model complexity  

---

### 🔹 Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

- Adds squared magnitude of coefficients as penalty: \( \lambda \sum w_j^2 \)  
- Shrinks coefficients towards zero but rarely makes them exactly zero  
- Useful when many small/medium sized coefficients are expected  

---

### 🔹 Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

- Adds absolute value of coefficients as penalty: \( \lambda \sum |w_j| \)  
- Can shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, performing feature selection  
- Useful to create sparse models and identify important features  

---

### 🔹 Model Evaluation

- Regularization strength controlled by hyperparameter \(\lambda\) or alpha  
- Proper tuning balances bias and variance, improving generalization  
- Effectiveness varies across datasets and problem types  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Ridge and Lasso help prevent overfitting by penalizing coefficient size  
- Lasso can simplify models by zeroing out some features  
- Choosing the right regularization technique depends on data and goals  
- Hyperparameter tuning is essential for best results

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Use cross-validation to find optimal regularization strength  
- Consider Lasso when feature selection is desired  
- Use Ridge when all features are expected to contribute  
- Combine both with Elastic Net if needed for balance
