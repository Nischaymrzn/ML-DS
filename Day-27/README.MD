### 🔹 Data Preprocessing Steps

**Key components:**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Removing or imputing missing data  
- **Encoding Categorical Features**: One-hot or label encoding  
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardization or normalization for numerical stability  
- **Train-Test Split**: Dividing data to evaluate model generalization

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Always inspect data for missing or inconsistent values first  
- Choose the right encoding method based on feature type  
- Use `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` before training  
- Wrap transformations inside a `Pipeline` or `ColumnTransformer` for better structure
