## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Conditional Probability

- Probability of an event given that another event has occurred  
- Fundamental for reasoning under uncertainty in ML  

---

### 🔹 Bayes’ Theorem

- Formula to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new data  
- Expressed as: P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / P(D)  

---

### 🔹 Machine Learning Applications

- Bayesian methods help incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs with evidence  
- Widely used in classification, spam filtering, and recommendation systems  

---

### 🔹 Naive Bayes Algorithm

- Assumes feature independence given the class  
- Calculates posterior probability to predict the most likely class  
- Simple, fast, and effective for many real-world classification problems

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Probability and Bayes’ Theorem provide a theoretical foundation for probabilistic classifiers  
- Naive Bayes leverages conditional independence assumptions to simplify calculations  
- Useful baseline model for classification tasks with high interpretability

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Carefully preprocess data to meet feature independence assumption as much as possible  
- Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Use smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing) to handle zero probabilities
