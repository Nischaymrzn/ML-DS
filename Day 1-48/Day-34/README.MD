## ✅ Today's Learning Objectives Completed

- Understanding logistic regression for binary classification tasks  
- Learning how the sigmoid function maps outputs to probabilities  
- Studying the formation of decision boundaries in classification

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Logistic Regression Overview

- A supervised learning algorithm for binary classification  
- Models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class  
- Uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to map linear combinations of features to probabilities between 0 and 1  

---

### 🔹 Sigmoid Function

- Formula: \( \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \) where \( z = w \cdot x + b \)  
- Converts any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1  
- Output interpreted as probability of the positive class  

---

### 🔹 Decision Boundary

- Threshold (usually 0.5) used to decide class labels from predicted probabilities  
- Decision boundary separates classes in the feature space  
- For logistic regression, decision boundary is linear in the feature space

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Logistic regression is a probabilistic linear classifier for binary outcomes  
- Sigmoid function ensures outputs are valid probabilities  
- Decision boundaries help classify new data points based on learned parameters

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Standardize features for better convergence during training  
- Use appropriate thresholding based on class distribution and problem context  
- Evaluate model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
