## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Overview

- A non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm  
- Classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k closest neighbors  
- Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean) are used to find neighbors  

---

### 🔹 Effect of k Value

- Small k (e.g., 1) can lead to noisy decision boundaries and overfitting  
- Large k smooths decision boundary but may underfit, ignoring local patterns  
- Choosing optimal k is critical for balance between bias and variance  

---

### 🔹 Implementation Notes

- Scaling features before KNN improves distance calculations  
- KNN is simple but computationally expensive on large datasets  
- Works well with clean, well-distributed data

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- KNN is intuitive and effective for classification with labeled data  
- Hyperparameter k significantly impacts model performance  
- Feature scaling is important for accurate distance measurement

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Use cross-validation to find the best k value  
- Normalize or standardize features before applying KNN  
- Consider dimensionality reduction if dataset has many features  
- Evaluate model accuracy and confusion matrix to understand classification results
