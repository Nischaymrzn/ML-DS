## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Gradient Descent

- An iterative optimization algorithm to minimize functions  
- Updates parameters by stepping opposite to the gradient direction  
- Step size controlled by learning rate to balance convergence speed and stability  

---

### 🔹 Connection to Gradient

- Gradient vector indicates direction of greatest increase  
- Moving against the gradient decreases the function value efficiently  

---

### 🔹 Optimization in One Variable

- Simple cases use the derivative to update parameters  
- Helps build intuition before extending to multivariable functions

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Gradient descent is a fundamental technique to find minima in optimization problems  
- The gradient direction and step size determine the optimization path  
- Practicing on simple functions builds a strong conceptual foundation
