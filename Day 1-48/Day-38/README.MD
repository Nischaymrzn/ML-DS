## 📝 Detailed Notes

### 🔹 Decision Tree Splitting

- Tree structure where nodes split data based on feature values  
- Each split aims to partition data to increase class purity in child nodes  

---

### 🔹 Key Concepts for Split Quality

- **Gini Impurity:** Measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element  
- **Entropy:** Measures the disorder or uncertainty in the dataset  
- **Information Gain:** Reduction in entropy or impurity achieved by a split

### 🔹 Decision Tree Classification

- Recursive binary splits until stopping criteria are met (e.g., max depth, min samples)  
- Easy to interpret and visualize decision rules  
- Prone to overfitting without proper pruning or regularization

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Decision trees use feature-based splits to classify data points  
- Gini Impurity and Entropy quantify split quality; Information Gain guides split selection  
- Practical implementation using Scikit-learn helps visualize and tune model

## 💡 Practical Implementation Tips

- Limit tree depth or minimum samples per leaf to avoid overfitting  
- Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters  
- Visualize trees for interpretability and debugging
